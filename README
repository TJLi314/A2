Questions: 
- Do we assume file size is infinite and we just keep creating pages for a table as needed?
- Do we have to do this in loadFromTextFile: myTable->setLastPage(-1)? Is there anything else we have to do in the MyDB_Table code?
- Are we allowed to use input file streams? (ifstreams)
- are all records written to a given page going to be of the same size?
